 **ABOUT my web project:**

------------
- *Bodyquestbox is an e-commerce site for selling CrossFit accessories and equipment. I started it in 2014, but in 2018 I made the website with WordPress. Since then, I gained the ambition to learn web programming and one day be able to make the website on my own and have full control on how secure it is, how it looks and what functions it offers. The knowledge learned along the way, will give me the opportunity to do that for others as well.*

- *I like unusual and non-standard approach in terms of design, therefore many pieces of the site are and will be unique, pleasing the customers and making them come back if they had good experience.*

**The site is not yet deployed to the internet**

## **Backend**
The web project contains:
* 12 entities + aggregate of 6
* 17+ service methods
* 9 controllers
* 6+ views

## **Features**

The website allows non-authenticated users to browse the site and the shop, put products in the basket and view them in the basket summary.

Checkout is allowed for authenticated user

Multi-step checkout wizard allows very fast and easy ordering with validation of data before next step.

Stipe payment integration confirms with webhooks if payment was successful or there was an error which is shown to the client.

On success, the order can be seen or client can see all orders made so far and their status.

Planned-
Facebook Messenger integration
Email on order success with invoice attached
Email to contact us
Refactor the DB to reflect:
* one product can be in multiple categories, one product can have multiple photos
* shipping methods should have shipping tables according to weight
Product details view should allow choice of product variants so weight is calculated on the backend and proper shipping fee is shown based on total weight of products in the basket
Bilingual support
